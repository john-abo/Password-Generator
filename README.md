# Password-Generator
As learned in a lecture involving the exploration in information security (U of C's CPSC 329), it was shown that a password consisting
of 4 randomly selected words would provide greater security and convenience for a user than a single word with replaced characters.

I fully acknowledge the vulnerability of publishing the dictionary I used for my passwords, however it is also advised to include small
changes to avoid using only words, such including 'l33t' speak and adding special characters or numbers.
